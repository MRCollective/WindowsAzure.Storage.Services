WindowsAzure.Storage.Services
-----------------------------

## Notice

This library is outdated and is now deprecated. We leave this here purely for interest, but do not recommend using it in a production environment.

It extends the Windows Azure Storage library by Microsoft with a set of services and repositories as well as a factory that makes it easy to dependency inject any Azure Storage calls into your code.

It removes a lot of the repetitive code that you would otherwise need to write again and again.
